<h2>COLLECTION AND USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We also collect non-personal information, or data in a form that cannot be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person.  We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purposes.  Non-personal information that we collect may include information regarding your activities on our website or our application, which may be aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of the Service are of most interest.</p>
<p>If we combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Statement.</p>
<h2>LOCATION-BASED SERVICES</h2>
<p>To provide location-based services to mobile application users of the Service, the Company or our partners may collect and use precise location data, such as the real-time geographic location of your device.  This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by the Company and our partners to provide location-based products and services.  We treat this location data as non-personal information.</p>
<h2>COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
<p>The TripCase website, mobile application, email messages, and advertisements may use "cookies" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.  These technologies help us to improve and to deliver a better and more personalized service by enabling us to:</p>

<p>You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the appropriate settings on your browser.  Check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.

<p>You may access, correct or delete your contact information and preferences through your TripCase account.  For other personal information, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access so you can request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if the Company is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.  We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.</p>
<h2>DATA SECURITY</h2>
<p>We have implemented reasonable measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure.</p>
<p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Any content, including personal information, that you contribute to be shared, published or displayed on the Service, or transmitted to other users of the Service, either via the Service or via social networking sites available through the Service, is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them.  We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Service.  You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your content, including personal information, that you contribute to be shared, published or displayed on the Service, or transmitted to other users of the Service, may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other users. Although we take efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to the Service. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk.</p>
<h2>CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13</h2>
<p>The Service is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under age 13.
